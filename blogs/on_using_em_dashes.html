            <p>Someone accused me of using AI for writing my blogs because I used em dashes (—) too often.</p>
            <p>Here's <a href="https://medium.com/data-science/reinforcement-learning-temporal-difference-sarsa-q-learning-expected-sarsa-on-python-9fecfda7467e">a blog</a> from 2019 that shows I've been using them for writing my blogs before writing with ChatGPT was a thing.</p>
            <h2>Do I use AI to write my blogs?</h2>
            <p>Yes—I—like—to—think—of—myself—as—<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sE1teB5bN-w">Rick Rubin</a>—of—writing—blogs.</p>
            <p>
            I don't have much writing abilities, english isn't even my first language and I know (almost) nothing about writing, but I love writing! I read and therefore I know what I like and what I don't like.
            Sometimes AI helps with that. Sometimes it suggests something useful, other times it confidently suggests absolute garbage. 
            In the end, I decide what stays.
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes AI gets ahead of itself and puts words in my mouth, I absolutely despise that and am actively trying to resist the temptation
            to let it dictate my narrative. I write my blogs on Cursor, and AI is doing it as I write this (I usually turn it off). 
            For example, the next thing it wants me to write is: "life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get".
            </p>
            <p>wtf AI, I feel like a schizophrenic madman right now.
