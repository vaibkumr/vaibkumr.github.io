                <h2>A Coffee Awakening</h2>
                <p>I had a "coffee awakening" back in 2018 during a trip to visit my aunt in South Korea. From a childhood of (rightfully so) demonizing coffee as an adult drink to an exam-anxious era of late-night milky-sugary drug called instant coffee, the complexities and charm of espresso-based drinks were revealed to my soul in the beautiful city of Seoul. Traveling on a budget, I was modest with my spendings. However, at the top of Lotte World Tower, the tallest building in South Korea, at 555 meters above the ground, I felt like I’m at the top of the world and therefore I decided to splurge. My weapon of choice? Coffee.</p>
                
                <p>With a cryptic menu that I couldn't decipher (espresso, cappuccino, latte, macchiato, IGNORANCEccino), I clung to the one word I recognized: "American" and ordered an Americano. The result? A hot pool of boiling black bitter gutter that swallowed an infinite number of sugar packets before mildly tasting sweet yet never drinkable. Cringing, I gulped it all, vowing never to let coffee-ignorance scam me out of my money again. I gazed out from the towering heights of a 123rd-floor window and felt weighed down by the crushing realization of my ignorance about the coffee menu. "No more", I revolted and read a bunch of blogs and books to learn more about coffee, one of which was "The Blue Bottle Craft of Coffee" that stuck with me the most (more on that in a different blog). I spent most of my remaining trip budget on trying different types of coffee and fell in love with the process. I’ve been chasing coffee ever since, wherever I go.</p>
            
                <p>Returning to Delhi after my trip, I was hit by the stark contrast in coffee culture between the two cities. Compared to Seoul, specialty coffee roasters were practically nonexistent here in Delhi. In fact, finding a café that served anything other than instant coffee felt like a rarity. Espresso machines were hard to come by, reserved for overpriced chains like Starbucks or Café Coffee Day. I remember ordering a cappuccino at the bakery of a 5-star hotel. It was served beautifully in a fancy cup over a pretty saucer along with all the fluff (biscuits and four kinds of sugar). Yet, it was, after all, a hot sugary milky water with some infused Nescafe coffee powder. The 199-rupee coffee at the Indira Gandhi International Airport was no different. Disappointing.</p>
            
                <p>In those days, back in 2018, my only saving grace was taking control of the matter in my own hand. I invested in a moka pot and relied on Blue Tokai’s elaborate supply chain, which delivered freshly roasted, authentic Indian Arabica coffee to my doorstep within a week of roasting. Blue Tokai became my personal remedy to an otherwise bleak coffee scene. Blue Tokai was my salvation, my saving grace, my beloved, ti amo... OK STOP.</p>
            
                <p>Things have changed for good. As of December 2024, the coffee landscape in Delhi has drastically improved, and you can find high-quality coffee easily accessible near most neighborhoods for your next date. I believe Blue Tokai is still leading the coffee scene in Delhi. It caused a revolution, a revolution that is still in the making. I shall stop before this blog turns into a love letter to Blue Tokai... or not.</p>
            
                <h2>How to Order a Perfect Cappuccino in Delhi</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Seek Out a Blue Tokai or Third Wave Coffee outlet:</strong> Locate your nearest outlet and order a cappuccino.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customized Instructions:</strong> Ask the barista to froth the milk at regular temperature and not overheat it. Instruct them specifically to avoid the chai-inspired tendency to overheat milk and do it only until it's barely too hot to touch.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The last instruction is the most important step because the baristas in India will deliberately overheat the milk during frothing and break down its texture, thereby ruining the milk consistency. India has a chai culture where tea is enjoyed when it is boiling hot. However, a cappuccino tastes the best in the 55-65°C range. My guess is that either the baristas are explicitly instructed to overheat milk or have received too many returns by the chai-loving customers for coffee being too cold.</p>
            
                <h2>Current Coffee Landscape of Delhi</h2>
                <p>Coffee shops and bars serve as the pulse of the beating heart of a society's social and cultural movement. Two key elements define a coffee shop space: their interior design, which sets the vibe, and the quality of their product, particularly the coffee in this case. While many places in Delhi seem to excel at creating the right ambiance (or perhaps I lack the sensitivity to critique their design), a significant number fall short when it comes to delivering quality coffee. In this blog, that's what I will delve into — my apparent expertise: a critique of the coffee.</p>
            
                <h3>Judging Coffee Chains: My Framework</h3>
                <p>Cappuccinos are my benchmark for evaluating coffee chains. They perfectly balance espresso, milk, and foam, showcasing both the quality of the beans and the barista's skill. My criteria for a good cappuccino include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Coffee Beans:</strong> Arabica beans roasted within 21 days are ideal. Everything else is subjective.</li>
                    <li><strong>Espresso Machines:</strong> Professional-grade machines are a must; automatic machines are a beige flag, no espresso machine is a glowing red flag. If you don't spot a hefty metallic machine adorned with intricate knobs and buttons, walk away and save your wallet. On the other hand, if you see a similar hefty machine but with a touchscreen, proceed with caution — scan that QR, but manage your expectations with a mix of hope and impending disappointment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> The cappuccino should be between 55–65°C. The source of overheating is usually not the espresso but the frothed milk, a result of over-infusing steam in milk.</li>
                    <li><strong>Espresso-to-Milk Ratio:</strong> The classic espresso ratio is 1:1:1 (espresso, milk, foam), though modern preferences lean towards 1:2:1 to 1:3:2. Anything milkier feels weak. Too much foam would make your drink collapse into itself by getting too cold too quick.</li>
                    <li><strong>Milk:</strong> Offering lactose-free options for milk like almond and oat milk is an important step towards inclusivity that every coffee shop should strive for.</li>
                </ol>
            
                <h2>Ranking Delhi’s Coffee Chains</h2>
                <h3>Tier 0: Artisan Specialty Roasters</h3>
                <p><strong>Kaffa Cerrado - The Roastery, Quick Brown Fox Coffee Roasters, Savorworks Coffee & Chocolate</strong></p>
                <p>These are small businesses. Individually owned coffee roasters who romanticize their craft and are passionate about coffee. Every cup is a masterpiece, personalized and meticulously thought of from sourcing the beans to roasting them, pulling the espresso shot and drawing a beautiful latte art. Following their journey on Instagram, talking to the owners and the baristas gives you a glance into their passion and helps you envision the future of coffee in Delhi. Truly inspiring to experience people who are passionate about their craft.</p>
            
                <p>I hope a lot more artisan individual roasters pop up in Delhi. The city is overcrowded, and unless you live nearby these shops, it is going to take you a long time and fighting traffic to reach them. As of now, availability is the trade-off for craftsmanship and dedication to coffee.</p>
            
                <h3>Tier 1: The Two Horsemen of Delhi's Coffee Culture</h3>
                <p><strong>Blue Tokai, Third Wave Coffee</strong></p>
                <p>They both have managed the herculean task of building the supply chain infrastructure that could bring high-grade microclimate-specific specialty coffee to your neighborhood table on a late-night date. Their home-grown beans from Karnataka (Attikan estate, Chikmagalur, etc.) are some of the best coffees I've ever tasted in my life.</p>
            
                <p>It is difficult to deem one better than the other. There are a few instances that make me think of Third Wave Coffee as less of a purist chain. While most Third Wave outlets I’ve visited use the classic La Marzocco espresso machines, I was disappointed to find their Connaught Place branch relying on an automatic Eversys espresso machine. Also, the beans on the shelf of Third Wave Coffee are often more than 1–2 months old, something I never observed in Blue Tokai outlets, making it more desirable. The consistency in equipment quality and the freshness of beans sets Blue Tokai apart and raises the bar for coffee quality over Third Wave Coffee.</p>
            
                <h3>Tier 2: Reliable But Not Specialty</h3>
                <p><strong>Tan Coffee, Chelvies Coffee</strong></p>
                <p>Both of these serve good-quality espressos and cappuccinos brewed using La Marzocco or similar professional-grade espresso machines. However, they fall short when it comes to specialty beans—their origins are unclear, and the flavor pales in comparison to Tier 1 and Tier 0 shops, often tasting noticeably stale. As of 2024, Chelvies doesn’t even list roast dates on their beans, while Tan doesn’t appear to offer coffee beans for retail at all. That said, their saving grace lies in the fact that the beans these two chains use for their espressos are certainly arabica, not overly roasted, not too acidic, not too stale, and definitely reliable for a decent cup of cappuccino.</p>
            
                <h3>Tier 3: Mainstream Capitalistic Chains</h3>
                <p><strong>Cafe Coffee Day, Starbucks, Barista</strong></p>
                <p>All of these have the same problem: questionable roast levels for beans, unknown sourcing, grossly wrong milk-to-espresso ratio, stale beans, and lack of consistency across stores. Also foam—too much foam, and the baristas seem to ignore the instructions.</p>
            
                <h3>Tier 4 (TODO): Instant Coffee Offenders</h3>
                <p><strong>Nothing Before Coffee, abCoffee</strong></p>
                <p>They don't seem to have an espresso machine. Are they serving instant coffee? Need to research more. TODO: go judge them.</p>
            
                <h3>My Favorite Coffee Experience in Delhi</h3>
                <p>The Shelfebook Bookstore & Café at Pacific Mall, NSP was where I had the best coffee during my trip to Delhi. They have an Astoria Tanya – Double Group espresso machine and serve freshly roasted Blue Tokai beans. The barista is friendly, kind, and passionate about coffee and even let me use the equipment to pour my own cappuccino. The small café is located inside the bookstore where you are allowed to read while sipping your coffee. Coffee smells better when infused with the smell of books. Pure bliss.</p>
            
                <p>I hope to contribute to the coffee landscape of Delhi. Maybe someday I will have my own specialty roasters coffee shop.</p>
