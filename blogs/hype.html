                No matter how clever you believe yourself to be, you're simply chasing trends, riding the wave of whateverâ€™s popular in a desperate attempt to get lucky. You're not addressing any genuine issuesâ€”you're creating them. And with your half-baked, poorly thought-out solutions, you're hoping to coast through on the hype, ignoring the fact that you're not actually solving anything real or lasting. You just want the money and fame, you don't really care about the problem and it doesn't excite you.

            <p>
                Or
            </p>
            You understand that the hype exists for a reasonâ€”thereâ€™s real value beneath it, and youâ€™re the one who can bring it to light. You see what others miss, and youâ€™re the one who will tap into its full potential. Youâ€™re the most knowledgeable, the one with the highest agency, the person who actually gets things done while others coast on trends. Youâ€™re different, you're special. You donâ€™t care about the money or the fameâ€”youâ€™re a conqueror. You see a problem and want to solve it using what's available, driven by the challenge, not the reward.
