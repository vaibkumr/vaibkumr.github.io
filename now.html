      <p><strong>Location:</strong> San Francisco, California</p>
      
      <strong>Professionally:</strong> I am working at a stealth startup with a legendary team, building the next generation of Social Media with Video AI. 
      Particularly, I am interested in creating social-learning-machines-- algorithms that learn from users, content and communities with deep context to make the world a better place. 
      I find my job quite fulfilling because:
      <ul>
        <li>Instagram has a net negative impact on my life. I only use it to stay updated with my friends but somehow I get sucked into scrolling reels for hours. This needs to change. Our future generation of children deserve better and we can do it, we can create a better altenrative social media platform that is healther, more meaningful, doesn't break the fabric of society,  and is less addictive. Social media has ceased to be social and is prompting loneliness. I find meaning in building our product.</li>
        <li>Some of my coworkers are famous people. Others are great engineers and researchers. Others are some of my best friends in the city who I can share my thoughts, personal problems, and ideas with.</li>
        <li>I am learning a lot about the latest in generative AI, LLMs, and video AI.</li>
        <li>We are ambitious. We aim for building a consumer product that is used by majority of the human population. I am waiting for the day when I run into someone using our app at the aiport while waiting for their flight.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Current Focus</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Meaning:</strong> I find life bearable if and only if I have all three: Purpose, Prosperity and Love. Including right now, I am always searching for them. Perhaps, the meaning of life is in this eternal search.</li>
        <li><strong>Bouldering:</strong> I managed to climb my first v6 in six months of starting bouldering. I am now trying to climb 3 more v6s and one v7. Come say Hi at <a href="https://touchstoneclimbing.com/">Dogpatch boulders</a>. We have a great community here.</li>
        <li><strong>Skiing:</strong> I feel the most alive when I am cruising down a mountain on skis. It's the greatest flow state I have ever experienced. Tahoe has got some great snow this year, I can't wait to go back.</li>
        <li><strong>Reading and Writing:</strong> I read books and then I write about them. I also write essays, some of which I publish here. I recently finished reading The picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. I am currently reading Narcissus and Goldmund by Hermann Hesse, What Lies Between Us by John Marrs, The Creature from Jekyll Island by G. Edward Griffin and a few others.</li>
        <li><strong>Spirituality:</strong> Buddhism has always attracted me. I am currenly reading the Dhammapada. I sometimes read Bhagavad Gita too but I mostly find it too abstract. Spirituality is something I want to have more importance in my life but it simply isn't so far, I am giving it a try nevertheless. I am arrogant but not arrogant enough to believe life has no spiritual meaning and that everything is scientific. I am convinced in the mysticism of our world.</li>
        <li><strong>Politics:</strong> I abhor apolitical people. Ignoring politics is a luxury I cannot afford, it has real world consequences. Tyrants thrive in ignorance. I am always seeking truth, challenging my beliefs and participating in political discourse whenever I can. I want to participate more and make the world a better place.</li>
        <li><strong>Fashion:</strong> Self expression is liberating. This is new, this is fun.</li>
        <li><strong>Health:</strong> In 2025 I built good habits of working out, eating healthy and sleeping well. I want to continue this in 2026 and beyond.</li>
        <li><strong>Taste:</strong> Life is about building taste. Taste in people, social constructs, music, art, food, fashion and everything that makes this world a beautiful place. Taste is built through experiences. While there is some objectiveity in taste, most of it is still subjective. Personal experiences are unique and therefore subjective. Maximizing experiences to build taste is another reason to continue living.</li>
      </ul>
